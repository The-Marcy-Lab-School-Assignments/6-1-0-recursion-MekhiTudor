# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer

Recursive functions are functions that call themselves. The cases are the `base` case and the `recursive` case. the recursive case is what happens or what we want to do with the input on the next call and the base case acts like a stopping condition for our recursive function so it doesn't go forever.

Nice! Just to be clear the Recursive Case is where the function calls itself with *modified parameters*, moving towards the base case. It defines the action to be taken on each recursive call.
