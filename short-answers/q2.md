# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer

Problems like tree traversals - and other problems using recursive structures - can be simplified using recursion. Its great for problems like this because it can be broken down into smaller pieces for you to be able to solve the problem more elegantly. To specify recursive structures are able to be broken down into smaller pieces.

# Teacher Feedback

~~You mentioned "trees" and "recursive structures," which is correct, but your response could be clearer and more specific. For instance, tree _traversals_ can be simplified with recursive implementations. Explain why recursion is suitable for this type of problem. Additionally, elaborate on what "recursive structures" means and provide more examples to solidify your response.~~

You got it!
