# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer

Problems like trees, and other problems using recursive structures(like graphs).

# Teacher Feedback
You mentioned "trees" and "recursive structures," which is correct, but your response could be clearer and more specific. For instance, tree *traversals* can be simplified with recursive implementations. Explain why recursion is suitable for this type of problem. Additionally, elaborate on what "recursive structures" means and provide more examples to solidify your response.
