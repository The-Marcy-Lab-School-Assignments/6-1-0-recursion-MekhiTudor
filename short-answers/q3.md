# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer

Benefits include more elegant readable code, and its ideal for recursive structures(or divide and conquer type algos). Draw backs include more space usage overall, risk of a stack overflow(which when we get caught repeating calls with not stopping condition - among other things - which leads us to overload our memory) and recursive solutions can be confusing to follow for the unaware.

# Teacher Feedback

Your response could benefit from clearer structuring and more detailed explanations. For example, distinguishing between types of recursive problems where recursion is more advantageous (like divide and conquer algorithms) versus where it could lead to inefficiencies would be helpful.

You got it!
